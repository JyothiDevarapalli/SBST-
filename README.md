# Analysis of Test Case Prioritization using Search Based Software Testing techniques(SBST)

This research plan focuses on evaluating Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, Artificial Fish School Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing for test case prioritization within the realm of search-based software testing (SBST). The primary objective is to assess these algorithms based on criteria such as code coverage and fault detection rate, ultimately identifying optimal execution orders.

Key Objectives:

Algorithm Evaluation: Compare the effectiveness of Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony Optimization, Artificial Fish School Algorithm, and Simulated Annealing in the context of SBST.

Test Case Prioritization: Investigate the impact of these algorithms on test case prioritization to enhance overall testing efficiency.

Performance Metrics: Evaluate criteria such as code coverage and fault detection rate to measure the efficacy of different execution orders.
